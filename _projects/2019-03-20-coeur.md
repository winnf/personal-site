### The Project
This project addresses high rate of uncontrolled hypertension by developing a solution that motivates consistent blood pressure monitoring. The unmet need is that there is no comprehensive blood pressure monitoring system that encourages behavior change by optimizing convenience and cost efficiency enough to incentivize users to develop a consistent habit of monitoring blood pressure. The physical cuff design implemented in commercially available products is inconvenient. Therefore, a cuff-less solution that minimizes this physical barrier is needed. Ultimately, the needs statement is to develop a solution that increases the rate of blood pressure measurement by optimizing user experience so that individuals can take control of their blood pressure.
